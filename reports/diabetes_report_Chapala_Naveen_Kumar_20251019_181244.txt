MEDICAL REPORT - DIABETES RISK PREDICTION
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Report Date: October 19, 2025 at 06:12 PM
Patient ID: DB-CHA-202510191812
Assessment Type: Comprehensive Diabetes Screening

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PATIENT INFORMATION
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Name: Chapala Naveen Kumar
Age: 14 years
Sex: Male
Contact: 8897464729

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Chapala Naveen Kumar, a 14-year-old male, presents with laboratory findings indicating a potential risk for diabetes. His fasting plasma glucose level is elevated at 123 mg/dL, while his body mass index (BMI) is within the normal range. Despite a genetic predisposition indicator, the AI-assisted diagnostic assessment classifies him as LOW RISK for diabetes, with a model confidence of 84.51%. However, it is essential to monitor his glucose levels and make lifestyle modifications to prevent the development of diabetes.

**PATIENT OVERVIEW**

- Age: 14 years
- Sex: Male
- Contact: 8897464729
- Pregnancy history: Not applicable (0 pregnancies)

**LABORATORY FINDINGS & ANALYSIS**

1. **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)**: 123 mg/dL (Normal: 70-100 mg/dL)
   - Clinical interpretation: Elevated
   - Significance to diabetes risk: Indicates impaired glucose regulation, which may be a precursor to diabetes.

2. **Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)**: 34 mmHg (Normal: 60-80 mmHg)
   - Clinical interpretation: Borderline
   - Significance to diabetes risk: Low diastolic blood pressure may be related to insulin resistance or other underlying metabolic issues.

3. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: 23 kg/m² (Normal: 18.5-24.9)
   - Clinical interpretation: Normal
   - Significance to diabetes risk: Within the normal range; however, continued monitoring is essential to prevent weight gain.

4. **2-Hour Serum Insulin**: 79 μU/mL (Normal: 16-166 μU/mL)
   - Clinical interpretation: Normal
   - Significance to diabetes risk: Within the normal range; however, insulin sensitivity should be monitored over time.

5. **Triceps Skin Fold Thickness**: 20 mm
   - Clinical interpretation: Elevated
   - Significance to diabetes risk: May indicate insulin resistance or increased body fat, which can contribute to diabetes development.

6. **Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF)**: 0.001 (Genetic predisposition indicator)
   - Clinical interpretation: Elevated
   - Significance to diabetes risk: Indicates a genetic predisposition to diabetes, which should be monitored closely.

**CLINICAL INTERPRETATION**

Chapala's laboratory findings suggest impaired glucose regulation, insulin resistance, and a genetic predisposition to diabetes. His elevated triceps skin fold thickness and borderline diastolic blood pressure further support the need for lifestyle modifications to prevent diabetes development. Despite the AI-assisted diagnostic assessment classifying him as LOW RISK, continued monitoring and intervention are crucial to prevent the onset of diabetes.

**DIABETES RISK STRATIFICATION**

- Classification: LOW RISK
- AI model confidence: 84.51%
- Medical rationale supporting the classification: While Chapala's laboratory findings indicate potential risk factors for diabetes, the AI-assisted diagnostic assessment suggests a low risk based on his age, BMI, and other parameters.

**CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **Immediate actions required**:
   - Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor glucose levels and adjust lifestyle modifications as needed.
   - Encourage Chapala to maintain a healthy diet and regular physical activity.

2. **Medications to consider (if high risk)**: Not applicable at this time.

3. **Specialist referrals needed**: Not applicable at this time.

4. **Diagnostic tests to order**:
   - Repeat fasting plasma glucose level in 3-6 months to monitor for changes in glucose regulation.
   - Consider an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) if glucose levels remain elevated.

5. **Timeline for interventions**:
   - Continue to monitor glucose levels and adjust lifestyle modifications as needed.
   - Re-evaluate diabetes risk in 1-2 years to determine if further interventions are necessary.

**LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS**

1. **DIETARY GUIDELINES**:
   - **Carbohydrate management**: Aim for 45-65% of daily calories from complex carbohydrates (whole grains, fruits, and vegetables).
   - **Foods to emphasize**: Include lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in the diet.
   - **Foods to limit/avoid**: Limit sugary drinks, refined carbohydrates, and saturated fats.
   - **Meal timing and portion control**: Encourage regular meals and portion control to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **PHYSICAL ACTIVITY**:
   - **Type of exercise**: Encourage a combination of aerobic and resistance exercises (e.g., brisk walking, cycling, or swimming).
   - **Frequency**: Aim for at least 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per day.
   - **Duration**: Aim for 30-60 minutes of physical activity per session.
   - **Intensity guidelines**: Encourage moderate-intensity physical activity (e.g., 50-60% maximum heart rate).

3. **WEIGHT MANAGEMENT**:
   - **Target weight range**: Maintain a healthy weight based on BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m²).
   - **Realistic weight loss goals**: Aim for a gradual weight loss of 0.5-1 kg per week.

4. **MONITORING**:
   - **Self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG)**: Not recommended at this time.
   - **What to track daily**: Monitor food intake, physical activity, and glucose levels (if fasting plasma glucose levels remain elevated).
   - **Warning signs to watch for**: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., increased thirst, urination, or fatigue).

**FOLLOW-UP CARE PLAN**

- Next appointment: Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3-6 months to monitor glucose levels and adjust lifestyle modifications as needed.
- Tests to repeat: Repeat fasting plasma glucose level in 3-6 months.
- Parameters to monitor at home: Monitor food intake, physical activity, and glucose levels (if fasting plasma glucose levels remain elevated).
- When to seek immediate medical attention: Seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of hyperglycemia develop or if glucose levels remain elevated.

**PHYSICIAN SUMMARY NOTES**

- Overall clinical impression: Chapala presents with potential risk factors for diabetes, including impaired glucose regulation and a genetic predisposition.
- Prognosis with and without intervention: With continued monitoring and lifestyle modifications, Chapala's risk for developing diabetes can be significantly reduced.
- Key patient education points: Encourage Chapala to maintain a healthy diet, engage in regular physical activity, and monitor glucose levels to prevent diabetes development.
- Encouragement and motivation: Encourage Chapala to take an active role in managing his health and to seek medical attention if symptoms of hyperglycemia develop.
