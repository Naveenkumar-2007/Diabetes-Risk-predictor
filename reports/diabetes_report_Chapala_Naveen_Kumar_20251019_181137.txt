MEDICAL REPORT - DIABETES RISK PREDICTION
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Report Date: October 19, 2025 at 06:11 PM
Patient ID: DB-CHA-202510191811
Assessment Type: Comprehensive Diabetes Screening

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PATIENT INFORMATION
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Name: Chapala Naveen Kumar
Age: 14 years
Sex: Male
Contact: 8897464729

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Chapala Naveen Kumar, a 14-year-old male patient, has been assessed for diabetes risk based on laboratory and clinical parameters. Key findings indicate a fasting plasma glucose level of 123 mg/dL, elevated 2-hour serum insulin level of 79 μU/mL, and a triceps skin fold thickness of 20 mm. Despite these findings, the AI-assisted diagnostic assessment predicts a LOW RISK for diabetes, with a model confidence of 84.51%. However, it is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely due to the elevated glucose and insulin levels.

**PATIENT OVERVIEW**

- Age: 14 years
- Sex: Male
- Contact: 8897464729
- Pregnancy History: Not applicable (0 pregnancies)

**LABORATORY FINDINGS & ANALYSIS**

1. **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)**: 123 mg/dL
   - Normal Reference Range: 70-100 mg/dL
   - Clinical Interpretation: Elevated
   - Significance to Diabetes Risk: Indicates impaired fasting glucose regulation, which may be a precursor to diabetes.

2. **Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)**: 34 mmHg
   - Normal Reference Range: 60-80 mmHg
   - Clinical Interpretation: Borderline Low
   - Significance to Diabetes Risk: Hypotension may be related to impaired glucose regulation or insulin resistance.

3. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: 23 kg/m²
   - Normal Reference Range: 18.5-24.9 kg/m²
   - Clinical Interpretation: Normal
   - Significance to Diabetes Risk: Within a healthy range, but weight management should still be encouraged.

4. **2-Hour Serum Insulin (2-HSI)**: 79 μU/mL
   - Normal Reference Range: 16-166 μU/mL
   - Clinical Interpretation: Elevated
   - Significance to Diabetes Risk: Indicates insulin resistance, which may be a precursor to type 2 diabetes.

5. **Triceps Skin Fold Thickness (TSFT)**: 20 mm
   - Normal Reference Range: Not established for adolescents
   - Clinical Interpretation: Elevated
   - Significance to Diabetes Risk: May indicate increased body fat, which can contribute to insulin resistance.

6. **Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF)**: 0.001
   - Genetic predisposition indicator
   - Clinical Interpretation: Low genetic risk
   - Significance to Diabetes Risk: Suggests a lower likelihood of genetic predisposition to diabetes.

**CLINICAL INTERPRETATION**

The patient's laboratory findings indicate impaired fasting glucose regulation and insulin resistance. However, the AI-assisted diagnostic assessment predicts a LOW RISK for diabetes. It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and address the underlying risk factors. The patient's triceps skin fold thickness and elevated 2-hour serum insulin level suggest the need for lifestyle modifications to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation.

**DIABETES RISK STRATIFICATION**

- **Risk Classification:** LOW RISK
- **Model Confidence:** 84.51%
- **Medical Rationale:** The patient's laboratory findings indicate impaired glucose regulation and insulin resistance, but the AI-assisted diagnostic assessment predicts a LOW RISK for diabetes.

**CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months to reassess the patient's glucose and insulin levels.
   - Encourage the patient to maintain a healthy diet and engage in regular physical activity.
2. **Medications to Consider:** None at this time.
3. **Specialist Referrals Needed:** None at this time.
4. **Diagnostic Tests to Order:** Repeat fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour serum insulin levels in 3 months.
5. **Timeline for Interventions:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

**LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS**

1. **DIETARY GUIDELINES:**
   - **Carbohydrate Management:** Aim for 45-65% of daily calories from carbohydrates.
   - **Foods to Emphasize:** Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
   - **Foods to Limit/Avoid:** Sugary drinks, refined carbohydrates, and saturated fats.
   - **Meal Timing and Portion Control:** Encourage three main meals and two to three snacks per day, with portion control to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **PHYSICAL ACTIVITY:**
   - **Type of Exercise:** Aerobic exercise (e.g., brisk walking, cycling) and resistance training (e.g., weightlifting).
   - **Frequency:** Engage in physical activity for at least 60 minutes per day, 5 days per week.
   - **Duration:** Aim for 30-60 minutes per session.
   - **Intensity Guidelines:** Moderate to high intensity exercise.

3. **WEIGHT MANAGEMENT:**
   - **Target Weight Range:** Based on BMI, aim for a weight range of 55-65 kg.
   - **Realistic Weight Loss Goals:** Aim for a weight loss of 0.5-1 kg per week.

4. **MONITORING:**
   - **Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG):** Not recommended at this time.
   - **What to Track Daily:** Food intake, physical activity, and weight.
   - **Warning Signs to Watch For:** Increased thirst, urination, or fatigue.

**FOLLOW-UP CARE PLAN**

- **Next Appointment Timeframe:** Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months.
- **Tests to Repeat and When:** Repeat fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour serum insulin levels in 3 months.
- **Parameters to Monitor at Home:** Food intake, physical activity, and weight.
- **When to Seek Immediate Medical Attention:** If the patient experiences increased thirst, urination, or fatigue.

**PHYSICIAN SUMMARY NOTES**

- **Overall Clinical Impression:** The patient has impaired fasting glucose regulation and insulin resistance, but the AI-assisted diagnostic assessment predicts a LOW RISK for diabetes.
- **Prognosis with and without Intervention:** With lifestyle modifications and regular follow-up appointments, the patient's condition is likely to improve.
- **Key Patient Education Points:** Encourage the patient to maintain a healthy diet, engage in regular physical activity, and monitor their condition closely.
- **Encouragement and Motivation:** Remind the patient that early intervention and lifestyle modifications can significantly improve their health outcomes.
